                        process with "Power Boosts." Daily power updates are 
                        free, but you need to log into the game and activate
                        them several times a day.

                        Game asset management is achieved through owning NFTs, which hold 
                        significant value in GrabCoinClub. They are the private property of
                         the player. With them, you can influence the metaverse economy, 
                         mine resources, manage guilds, travel between planets, and enhance
                        your Avatar's characteristics.
